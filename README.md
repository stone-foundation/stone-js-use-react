React integration for Stone.js, universal rendering, SSR hydration, layouts, pages, snapshots, head management, and more.

---

## Overview

**`@stone-js/use-react`** connects the Stone.js Continuum Architecture to the React ecosystem.

It provides:

- Universal rendering for **SSR** and **SPA**
- Powerful `Page` and `Layout` components with optional decorators
- A smart `Snapshot` system to sync server/client state seamlessly
- Dynamic `<StoneLink>`, `<StoneClient>`, and `<StoneServer>` rendering
- Integration hooks for popular tools and design systems

Use it to build fully reactive apps that run everywhere, Node.js, the browser, or serverless platforms, without giving up fine-grained control over context and rendering strategy.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stone-js/use-react
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This package is **pure ESM**. Make sure your `package.json` includes `"type": "module"` or configure your bundler accordingly.

## Usage

This package is designed to be used inside a Stone.js app and integrates deeply with its lifecycle, adapter system, and blueprint configuration.

You can define Pages and Layouts:

```ts
import { Page } from '@stone-js/use-react'

@Page('/about')
export class AboutPage {
  render() {
    return <div>About Stone.js</div>
  }
}
```

You can hydrate data with snapshots:

```ts
import { Stone } from '@stone-js/core'
import { Snapshot } from '@stone-js/use-react'

@Stone({ alias: 'userService' })
export class UserService {
  @Snapshot()
  showProfile() {
    return { name: 'John Doe' }
  }
}
```

You can render elements conditionally:

```tsx
<StoneClient>Visible on client</StoneClient>
<StoneServer>Visible on server</StoneServer>
```

And much more.
